AgenTrav 🌍
Connecting the World’s Travel Trade
Welcome to AgenTrav! We are building the world’s most comprehensive, AI-enriched map of the travel industry.

Our goal is simple but ambitious: to map 90% of the world's travel agents and create a transparent, organized, and accessible ecosystem for everyone—from hotels and tourism boards to individual travelers.

Think of us as the bridge connecting destinations with the people who sell them.

👋 What is AgenTrav?
AgenTrav is a B2B travel-tech platform that turns scattered information into actionable intelligence. We are creating a unified directory where travel professionals can be found, understood, and connected with.

We help the industry in two main ways:

🏨 For Hotels, DMCs & Tourism Boards
Discover Partners: Find out exactly who is selling your destination (e.g., Who is selling the Maldives in Mumbai?).

Market Intelligence: Track distribution across global source markets.

Smart Growth: Identify and build partnerships in specific cities based on real data, not guesswork.

✈️ For Travelers
Find Experts: Locate reputable agents in your city.

Niche Discovery: Find specialists for specific needs (e.g., Honeymoons, MICE, Umrah, or European tours).

Verify: Check agency details and specializations before you book.

📍 Our Reach
We are growing every day! Currently, our platform hosts:

60,000+ Travel Agencies

6,000+ Cities

195+ Countries

Top Coverage Areas: India, Bangladesh, Maldives, GCC, UK, and Europe.

Each profile is designed to give you a snapshot of the agency, including their location, contact info, web presence, and AI-inferred specializations (like whether they focus on luxury cruises or visa services).

🧠 Powered by AI
We believe in using technology to make sense of the noise. AgenTrav utilizes advanced Artificial Intelligence to analyze publicly available data from across the web.

Instead of just listing names, our system "reads" the data to understand an agent's focus areas, destinations, and services. This allows us to provide a directory that is not just a list, but a smart, searchable database.

Note: We strictly use public data. Agents always have the power to claim, update, or correct their profiles to ensure accuracy.

🗺️ The Ecosystem
We operate across two primary hubs:

🇮🇳 AgenTrav.in – The definitive directory for the Indian travel market.

🌍 AgenTrav.com – Our global map, analytics platform, and hotel partner tools.

🚀 What’s Coming Next? (2025 Roadmap)
We are constantly shipping new features. Here is a peek at what we are building:

The Intelligence Layer: We are rolling out a "Destination Demand Index" to visualize where demand for specific locations is coming from.

Community Features: High-quality city guides and a system for agents to verify and badge their profiles.

B2B Power Tools: Dedicated dashboards for hotels and tourism boards to automate outreach and view country-level demand analytics.

Virtual Connect: Future events to digitally bridge the gap between agents and properties.

🤝 Let's Collaborate
We love working with forward-thinking partners.

Hotels/DMCs: Want to expand your distribution network?

Tourism Boards: Need data on global agent activity?

Influencers: Interested in our Project FOMO marketing initiatives?

If you want early access or to discuss a partnership, we’d love to hear from you.
